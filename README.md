# Statistical Evaluations

In this directory, you'll find 3 python scripts: 

StatisticalVisualizations.py

MannWhitneyUtest.py

DistributionFits.py

Test data for the project can be found in the data directory.
These scripts are supposed to be used in the following order.


## StatisticalVisualizations

This script is used to construct 4D histograms, violin plots, and boxplots for a quick visualization of data.  
You will need the following packages for this script: seaborn and pandas. 


## MannWhitneyUtest

This script was used to make a first order estimate on whether distributions within different bins of data were statistically significant. 
You will need the scipy package for this script. 

## DistributionFits

This was used to make skewed normal and lognormal distribution fits for different bins of data in order to compare distributions and their moments.
You will need the scipy package for this script.
